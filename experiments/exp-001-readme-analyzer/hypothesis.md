# Experiment 001: GitHub README Analyzer

## Hypothesis

Developers struggle to write effective READMEs. A free web tool that analyzes a GitHub repo's README and provides a score + actionable suggestions will attract users and can be monetized through GitHub Sponsors, affiliate links, or premium features.

## Target Market

- Open source developers wanting to improve their project visibility
- First-time project creators who don't know README best practices
- Companies/teams maintaining documentation standards

## Solution

Web app that:
1. Takes a GitHub repo URL as input
2. Analyzes the README for:
   - Essential sections (Installation, Usage, Contributing, License)
   - Code examples presence
   - Badges (build status, coverage, etc.)
   - Length and readability
   - Images/screenshots
3. Returns a score (0-100) + specific improvement suggestions

## Success Criteria (7 days)

**Minimum viable (PIVOT decision point):**
- ✅ Tool built and deployed
- ✅ 100+ unique visitors
- ✅ 10+ GitHub stars on tool repo
- ✅ Posted to HN, Reddit r/SideProject, Twitter

**Success (KEEP decision point):**
- ✅ 500+ unique visitors
- ✅ 50+ GitHub stars
- ✅ 5+ organic mentions/shares
- ✅ 1+ sponsor or $1+ revenue

**Failure (KILL):**

- ❌ No engagement (comments/stars) on launch posts

## Budget

$0 - using free tiers only:
- Vercel/Netlify for hosting
- GitHub API (free)
- Rule-based analysis (no AI costs initially)

## Timeline
